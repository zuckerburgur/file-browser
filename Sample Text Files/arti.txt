Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, decision-making, language understanding, visual perception, and learning. AI technologies range from narrow applications like speech recognition and recommendation algorithms to more complex systems that simulate general human cognitive abilities. With rapid advancements, AI is increasingly integrated into various industries, enhancing efficiency, enabling new capabilities, and raising important ethical and societal considerations about its impact on employment, privacy, and decision making. intelligence. school.txt
